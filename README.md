# Machine_Learning
This is the Repository that I put all my Machine_Learning Works in it.

To run the code, for both projects. You will need to download the dataset form the kaggle first.

Project dataset which includes item_categories.csv, items.csv, sales_train.csv, shops.csv and test.csv.

Second, need to install several special packages in anaconda, includes catboost, xgboost etc.

And some steps in the code may cost a long time to run since the dataset is large.
